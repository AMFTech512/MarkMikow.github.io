# MarkMikow.github.io  -  AKA Calculus Conqueror!
I am an AP Calculus BC teacher (among other maths) and have been teaching since 2002.
I began learning website development on my own over this past summer. After trying out various coding sites, I finally got the ball rolling by joining freeCodeCamp on June 17, 2017.
My intent on learning frontend website development was to create a website where AP Calculus students could hone their skills in the multiple choice questions section.
It is now 51 days later and I have the website up!
Granted, it is not very much, but I have done the entire thing on my own. The final layout (always subject to change) will be:
1) The home page will contain a list of Calculus topics for students to choose from.
2) Once a topic has been chosen, a random question will be displayed with 4 answer options with radio buttons.
3) When the submit button is pushed, if the answer is correct, the student can go to the next question by pushing the "next" button. If the answer is incorrect, then the student will have a choice to 
a) try again
b) get a hint
c) move on.

Ultimately, I would like this to be a game, in which students navigate through a labyrinth within a castle, battling dragons and other beasts by solving Calculus problems, and gaining points in the process.
In the meantime, I have my work cut out for me!

This is an open source project and any suggestions and help would be greatly appreciated!
Thank you to Quincy Larson and freeCodeCamp!
